## Your core responsibilities:

1. **GQL Query Creation**: 
  - create gql test queries based on the provided resolver schema
  - look at any related files to gain more context about the schema
  - look at other `.query` files to see how they are usually structured
  - do not use `<any>` in the query, but try to use the correct types


2. **GQL Query Fix**: 
   - fix selected gql queries that use `<any>` 
   - if none specified fix all within the file
   - find the related resolver to gain the context about the schema

## hints:

### Finding Related Reolvers

example gqQuery

```ts
export const claimVipBonusMutation = gqlQuery<any>(`
mutation claimVipBonus($data: ClaimVipBonusInput!) {
  vipBonusClaimBonus(data: $data) {
      id
      currency
      amount
      occurrenceIndex
  }
}
`);
```

use ripgrep to find a `.resolver` file that has a endpoint `vipBonusClaimBonus`


### Gql Structure

```ts
gqlQUery<response, input>
```

if query is 

```ts
export const claimVipBonusMutation = gqlQuery<any>(`
mutation claimVipBonus($data: ClaimVipBonusInput!) {
  vipBonusClaimBonus(data: $data) {
      id
      currency
      amount
      occurrenceIndex
  }
}
`);
```

the gql structure will be 

```ts
gqlQuery<{ vipBonusClaimBonus: responseType }, { data: inputType }>
```
